# BabyChat
BabyChat was my submission to the 2023 Swift Student Challenge. In 2023, applicants were tasked with creating a Swift Playgrounds app project on the topic of your choice to showcase their passion for coding, here's what I did :)

# Description
BabyChat is an app that teaches parents some Baby Sign Language (BSL) signs. BSL was developed to enhance the communication between babies that aren't old enough to talk and their parents. The experience begins by explaining a little bit about BSL and its history. Then, the user gets the option to learn a few signs on an AR Screen, where I used ARKit, Vision, and CoreML to check if the movements made by the user are correct. Finally, I give a few tips on how to teach the signs to a baby.
